## Repository Setup
As ExtraUtilities 2 is ARR, this repository requires initial setup to generate patches.

### Initial setup
- Before initial import, set Project's Java to `Java 8 version 151`. This is required for patch generation to work properly.
- Execute task `xu2 patcher/Setup XU2 Source` to download, patch and setup original XU2 sources.
- (Optional) Add Gradle Wrapper to the `Patched` source files, current minimum version for IntelliJ Idea is 4.5.

### Launching the client and debugging
Use Gradle task `xu2 patcher ~ patched/Run Client ~ 1.12` or `1.12:runClient` (XU2 Task) to launch the client.<br>
Current setup requires attaching a debugger for the client to launch.

###### Note: `1.12:runClient` task can sometimes hang on the last task, not launching the client. This requires manual cancellation of the build.<br> Both tasks have currently broken console log output.

### Generating Patches and building the project.
You need to execute tasks provided below in the provided order to generate patches.
- `xu2 patcher ~ patched/Generate Patches ~ 1.12` - Generates patches for the Patcher
- `xu2 patcher ~ patched/Generate Patches ~ Project` - Generates patches for the project setup
- `xu2 patcher ~ patched/Generate Binary Patches ~ 1.12` - Generates Binary Patches
- `xu2 patcher/Release Jar ~ 1.12` - Builds the XU2 Patcher with just generated patches.

This is required, as using dependencies for those doesn't update the source files for each task.

### Pull Requests
Please point the pull requests to the `dev` branch of the project ðŸ˜Š Additional information on the patches included and pre-testing the build is also welcome!
