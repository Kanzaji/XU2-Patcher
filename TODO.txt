TODO:
- Add a downloading task of the UX2 Source
- Find a way to use already existing repo and gradle files, instead of compiling the mod myself lol
- setup patcher to patch the second github repo
- if base is not necessary (aka it compiles without changes), remove it.
- remove old IC2 Stuff
- make the patcher compile and work XD
